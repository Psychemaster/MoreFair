## 2.2.7 [PATCH]: Changing the penalty for getting graped

Balancing:
Normally you would either get forced to multi or loose half of your power and get set back to 0 points. Now you will
loose 1 of your multi. So if you have 4 multi, getting graped sets you back to x3 +0 as if you just multied from x2.

### Rule-Changes:

- Adding 2 new rules, see discord for the reasoning for these rules.
- Rule 10: Griefing is prohibited; repeatedly and intentionally making the game worse for everybody else can lead to a
  warning and ban.
- Rule 11: All members of the community are expected to comply with official requests from moderators. If you think any
  mod is misusing their power please write @kaliburg a message on discord.

### Balancing:

- Normally you would either get forced to multi or loose half of your power and get set back to 0 points.
- Now you will loose 1 of your multi. So if you have 4 multi, getting graped sets you back to x3 +0 as if you just
  multied from x2.

## 2.2.6 [PATCH]: Hotfix for L1 not always rolling DEFAULT

### Fixes:

- L1 is now always rolling DEFAULT, even if it's a CHAOS round

## 2.2.5 [PATCH]: FREE_AUTO formula change

### Balancing:

- SLOW and FAST no longer impact how close the FREE_AUTO gets applied to ladders
- FREE_AUTO now applies to the ladder = floor(topLadder / 2) - 2
- This might not apply instantly, but only once the next ranker promotes into a corresponding ladder

## 2.2.4 [PATCH]: Round Modifier impacts the Round Base Point Requirement

### Improvements:

- SLOW, FAST and CHAOS now slightly impact the Round Base Point Requirement.

## 2.2.3 [PATCH]: Back-to-Back Protection for Rounds

### Improvements:

adding a back-to-back protection for round-types, making it almost impossible to roll the same combinations of modifiers
for the round twice

## 2.2.2 [PATCH]: Spark and Statistics Endpoints

### Features:

- using spark and mongodb to get some more accurate statistics regarding the game

### API-Changes:

- changing the api for the raw round stats from /roundStats /api/stats/round/raw

  /api/stats/round
- adding a new api endpoint for a analysis of the activity in the last 28 days at /api/stats/activity

## 2.2.1 [PATCH]: CHEAP and EXPENSIVE also scales with ladders

### Balancing:

- CHEAP ladders have the cost to bias and multi reduced as if they are half their ladder number and then by and
  additional 50%.
- EXPENSIVE ladders have the cost to bias and multi increased as if they are 1.5x their ladder number and then by and
  additional 50%.

## 2.2.0 [MINOR]: CHEAP and EXPENSIVE Ladder Types

### Features:

- CHEAP ladders have the cost to bias and multi reduced by 50%.
- EXPENSIVE ladders have the cost to bias and multi increased by 50%.
- CHEAP ladders are more common on FAST rounds, and EXPENSIVE ladders are more common on SLOW rounds.
